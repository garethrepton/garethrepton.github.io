title: Patterns to reduce unit test friction series
tags: unittesting c# .Net patterns autofixture

I've decided to write a bunch of patterns and practices up in a concise way that help to make unit testing in .Net a better, lower friction experience. Getting started unit testing can be quite painful, and its not usually until after you have written large numbers of tests that many issues come to light.

They don't apply to all situations, but they are hopefully a distillation of a whole heap of knowledge I've gained over the years when reading and applying unit test practices and TDD.

The current patterns and practices posts in this series are:

1. [Pattern 1 - Avoid explicit construction] (http://www.garethrepton.com/Reduce-Unit-Test-Friction-Pattern-1-Avoid-explicit-construction/)
2. [Pattern 2 - Abstract external dependencies] (http://www.garethrepton.com/Reduce-Unit-Test-Friction-Pattern-2-Abstract-External-Dependencies/)
3. [Pattern 3 - Never create time dependent tests] (http://www.garethrepton.com/Reduce-unit-test-friction-patterns-3-Never-create-time-dependent-tests/)
